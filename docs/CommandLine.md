Command Line
============

The [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) `sm` command line tool is installed via [npm](http://npmjs.org):

	npm install -g sm

For usage see:

	sm -h


Notes
=====

  * The most important command is `sm status` to see the current state of a package and its dependencies.
  * `sm` always treats the `cwd/pwd` as the root of the package.
